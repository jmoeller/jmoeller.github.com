Golive: A simple deployment tool
---

Reads a simple JSON configuration
Listens to webhooks from a number of providers (github and bitbucket atm -- possible to write your own)
Calls a script based on repository and branchname. (i.e., whatever deploy script you have. Ansible, Capistrano, shell, etc)
That's it.

First go project, please critique, improve - I want to learn.

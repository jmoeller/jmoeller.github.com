title: A roguelike in Rust from scratch
categories:
  - rust

Two tings have collided. Me wanting to learn Rust and the r/roguelikedev summer tutorial follow-along. My main motivation (for now) is learning Rust, so I’ve set a restriction for myself: As long as I can feasibly achieve it, I won’t be using external dependencies. To keep things manageable, that means that my rogue like will be old school and take place in a plain ol' terminal.

- project setup
- Drawing a canvas to the terminal
- Representing the world
- Positioning the character
- Accepting input
- Moving the character
